# PokeApp
An application that was inspired by the app, Pokemon Go. PokeApp contains a small scale Kanto Region PokeDex, Rocket Leader Counters, and a Pokemon Type Counter Picker.

Decided to do this project because of myself playing Pokemon GO and also my family. 
It features a small scale Pokedex that JSON API calls from a online server to display Pokemon. 
Also, has a tab where you can find the type counters for the Rocket Leaders such as Cliff, Arlo, and Sierra.
Lastly, the app has a picker style selector where you can choose what Poketype you want to find the weaknesses for.

***Disclaimer: If you view the files, the folder and workspace is named as "PokeDex". It's like this because, I essentially was building a Pokedex at first but decided to add more content to the app, hence why the folder name. I haven't learned to rename the folder and namespace properly without breaking the app at the moment. Sorry for the inconvenience.***
