# PokeApp
Pokemon GO App that displays a small scale PokeDex, Rocket Leader Counters, and Pokemon Type Counter Picker

Decided to do this project because of myself playing Pokemon GO and also my family. 
It features a small scale Pokedex that JSON API calls from a online server to display Pokemon. 
Also has a tab where you can find the type counters for the Rocket Leaders such as Cliff, Arlo, and Sierra.
Lastly, the app has a picker style selector where you can choose what Poketype you want to find the weaknesses for.
